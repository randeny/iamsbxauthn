# CWI B2C

This project is a starting point for integrations with Azure Active Directory (AAD) Business to Consumer (B2C).  The project structure matches a CI/CD pipeline hosted in iam-costco.visualstudio.com - B2C Project.

The folder structure:

```
[project-root]
-- policy (dir containing policy set)
-- resource (dir containing UX elements)
-- README.md (this file)
-- package.json (platform and application configuration/dependencies)
-- package-lock.json (platform and application dependencies)
```

This is our meager test.
